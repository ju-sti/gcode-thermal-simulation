Meeting outline:

software:
1. cloud based computing:
  - cline side computing: running JavaScript on client side. The advantage is we
  don't need to provide computing power. The disadvantage is it is hard to hide
  the code from user.
  - server side computing: let user upload a file, the server can send the file
  to a remote server to compute and send the results back. The advantage is we
  can hide the code completely from the user. The disadvantage is data transmission
  overhead.

Paper:
1. Add a figure of active body to the paper;
2. Rewrite the convergence and stability analysis of the numerical scheme;

Inverse Problem:
1. I formulated a integer programming (IP) to calculate the optimal tool path in a layer
The layer is divided into grids
Decision variable: The deposition time of each grid
Objective function: minimize the manufacturing time
Constraints: The deposition time difference between adjacent grid is less than some value;
